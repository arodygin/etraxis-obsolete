Since datatype of a lot of data columns has been changed,
the upgrade of existing  Microsoft SQL Server database is
quite tricky. It requires significant effort to develop a
script which does all the work,  while I am even not sure
that there is at least one  MS SQL Server installation of
eTraxis exists in the world at the moment.  So, I decided
do not create such script  this time,  but if I was wrong
and you are the one, please drop me a line and I will try
to help you with upgrade.
